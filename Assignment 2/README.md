This project consists of three multithreaded servers:
1. Music Streaming Server
2. HTTP Server
3. Chatroom Server

These servers are implemented in C and utilize TCP sockets for communication. Each server is capable of handling multiple client connections concurrently by spawning threads for each connection.

In implementing these servers, we referred to the documentation of Linux for understanding the functionalities of various functions and their return values.

For detailed usage and functionality of each server, please refer to their respective sections above. These servers can be compiled using any standard C compiler and executed with the appropriate command-line arguments.
